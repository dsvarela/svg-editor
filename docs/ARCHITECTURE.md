# Architecture

Why the code looks the way it does. Each section is a decision, what it bought,
and what it cost.

---

## 1. Nodes, not commands

**The founding decision, and every other one follows from it.**

yqnn's editor stores an array of command objects — `MoveTo`, `CurveTo`,
`EllipticalArcTo` — and derives point positions by walking the whole path from
the start. That is why its interface is a command table: the model *is* a
command table. It also means every geometric operation has to special-case ten
command types. Its `EllipticalArcTo.scale` is 28 lines of conic-section algebra
whose entire purpose is keeping an ellipse expressible as an `A` command.

Here a subpath is a run of nodes. Each node owns its anchor and up to two
handles. Commands exist only in `parse.ts` on the way in and `serialise.ts` on
the way out. Nothing between them knows they exist.

What that buys:

- A transform is one matrix applied to every point. No special cases at all —
  compare `affine.ts` (79 lines, covering everything) to that arc-scaling method.
- No relative-versus-absolute distinction to carry around.
- Arcs and shorthands cannot desynchronise from what is drawn, because they no
  longer exist once parsed.

What it costs: the serialiser has to *re-derive* a good spelling rather than
remembering one. See §8.

## 2. All segments are cubics

`M L H V C S Q T A` are read on input and written on output; in between there
are only cubic Béziers. Arcs are converted by the SVG 1.1 endpoint-to-centre
formulas (F.6.5, with the radii correction from F.6.6) and then flattened to
cubics; quadratics are degree-elevated.

The conversion is one-way. A shape imported as an arc will not come back out as
an arc. That is a real loss, accepted deliberately: keeping arcs as arcs is
exactly the special-casing §1 exists to avoid, and every operation — split,
transform, boolean, offset — would have to grow an arc branch.

## 3. A straight segment has no handles

A handle is `null` when the segment it governs is straight, rather than a
control point sitting on top of its anchor.

This makes "is this segment a line?" an exact boolean rather than a float
comparison, which is what lets the serialiser emit `L`/`H`/`V` losslessly
instead of guessing from near-zero distances. `segmentIsLine` is two `=== null`
checks.

The cost is that geometry code cannot assume a handle exists. `segmentAsCubic`
widens a line into a cubic with its controls on the endpoints, so downstream
code sees a uniform shape while the model still remembers the truth.

## 4. Handles are absolute, not offsets

`hIn` and `hOut` are document coordinates, not deltas from the anchor.

Absolute costs one addition when moving an anchor. Offsets would cost a
conversion on every hit-test, render and transform — all of which happen far
more often than anchor moves.

## 5. Transforms are baked, never stored

Rotating a shape rewrites its points. There is no transform matrix hanging off
a shape waiting to be composed at render time.

This means what you see in the source box is what is actually stored: no hidden
coordinate system, no `transform=` attribute that the numbers have to be read
through. Imported `transform` attributes are baked on the way in for the same
reason.

The cost is accumulated floating-point drift under repeated transforms, and
that a rotation is not undoable by rotating back — it is undoable through the
undo stack, which is where it belongs.

## 6. A point is a point

There is no stored node type. Continuity — corner, smooth, symmetric — is
**derived from the handles** wherever it is needed (`continuityOf` in
`core/types.ts`).

A stored flag can disagree with the geometry, and did in every editor that has
one: a file can claim `smooth` while its handles sit at ninety degrees. Worse
for us, an imported path has no such flag to import, so everything read as
`corner` and dragging a handle on a visibly smooth imported curve put a kink in
it.

Deriving it means:

- Nothing to choose before drawing. Draw points; the handles decide.
- The marker on screen cannot lie, because it is computed from the same
  geometry every frame.
- "Make this smooth" is a real edit to the handles, not a mode change. The old
  version set a flag, changed nothing visible, and silently altered the next
  drag.

`moveHandle` reads the relationship **before** it mutates. This is the whole
trick: afterwards the pair is no longer collinear and would always read as a
corner, so a smooth node would break itself on its first drag. Having read it,
mirroring produces exactly equal lengths, so the relation is self-maintaining
for the life of a drag. `Alt` breaks the pair, and "broken" needs no flag to
persist — it is just non-collinear geometry.

Two tolerances, in `core/types.ts`:

- **Collinearity: 1e-4 radians.** Not an epsilon on the raw numbers. A rotation
  is exact in theory and nearly exact in floating point, so a tight test would
  turn a mirrored pair into a corner after a rotate-and-bake. 1e-4 rad is
  ~0.006°, far below what anyone can place by eye and far above that drift.
- **Equal length: 1e-6 relative.** A non-uniform scale legitimately destroys
  equal lengths, and correctly demotes symmetric to smooth.

### Making a corner smooth

Because the reading is derived, `setContinuity` has to change geometry or it
changes nothing. `corner` removes both handles. `smooth` and `symmetric` used to
decline outright on a node that had none, which was correct about the model and
useless as a button: nothing moved and nothing said why. They now materialise
the missing handles where the hollow ghosts are drawn — a third along each
neighbouring segment — and align from there. A handle sitting on its own chord
leaves that segment the same straight line it was, so the drawing does not jump;
only its spelling changes, from `L` to a `C` that traces it.

Two cases still have nothing to do, and both now say so:

| | Why |
|---|---|
| An end of an open subpath | No segment on the outside, so no handle to invent and nothing to align against |
| Smooth on a symmetric node | Symmetric *is* smooth — collinear handles of equal length. The only way to make the weaker reading true is to break the equality, which is a change nobody asked for |

## 7. Bend is a view, not a replacement

`core/bend.ts` describes a curved segment with two numbers — how far it bows
away from the chord, and how taut it is — after TikZiT's edge model, which
[quiver](https://q.uiver.app/) and TikZ itself independently arrive at.

It is a **view over the handles**, not a second representation. The model still
stores two control points; `bendToHandles` and `bendOf` convert. One source of
truth means a bend and a hand-dragged handle can never disagree, and dropping
back into free-handle editing costs nothing.

`bendOf` returns `null` for an asymmetric segment, which is how the UI knows to
stop offering the bend control. A straight segment reads as angle 0, so it can
be bent directly without being "converted" to a curve first.

## 8. The serialiser re-derives the shortest spelling

Since the model has no commands, output is reconstructed: absolute versus
relative per command, whichever is shorter; `H`/`V` where an axis is unchanged;
`L` where the handles are null; `S` where a control is the reflection of the
previous one; and `Q` where a cubic is exactly a degree-elevated quadratic.

The parser reads everything (`M L H V C S Q T A Z`, relative or absolute); the
serialiser deliberately emits a narrower set. `T` is never written — its
reflection rule chains across commands, so a single edited node changes the
meaning of every `T` after it, which is a poor trade for a few bytes.

Two things learned the hard way here, both preserved as comments in the code:

**Track the pen through the emitter, not alongside it.** Relative output
accumulates: each command's numbers are relative to where the previous one left
the pen, so the serialiser must know that position *as the text encodes it*.
Rounding with `Math.round(v*f)/f` while emitting with `toFixed` produces
different answers for binary values just under a halfway point, and the error
banks one grid step at a time. It took a 2 000-segment test to surface.

**Handles never affect the pen.** Only anchors need rounding-aware comparison.
An earlier "fix" that quantised whole subpaths broke `Q` recovery, because
`cubicAsQuad` amplifies control-point rounding by 1.5×.

## 9. Every drawn gridline is a snap position

`gridDisplayFor` in `view/viewport.ts` takes the step the tools actually snap to
and decides what to draw from it. The contract is one-directional and exact:
**every line on screen is a position the pointer can land on.**

This replaced a real defect. The canvas used to draw an adaptive decade step
derived from zoom while `controller.ts` snapped to the user's fixed `gridStep`,
so at most zoom levels you were aiming at a lattice that was not on screen. For
an editor whose entire premise is the grid, that is the wrong bug to carry.

The two obvious fixes are both wrong on their own:

- **Snap to the drawn step.** Then your coordinates depend on your zoom level,
  which destroys the reason to have a grid in an icon editor.
- **Draw the snap step.** A step of 1 across a 10 000-unit view is 10 000 lines,
  which is a solid grey rectangle and a layout cost to match.

So the drawn step is `gridStep × m`, with `m` a whole number off the 1-2-5
ladder — the smallest that keeps lines at least 9 px apart. Zooming out thins
the grid to every 2nd, 5th, 10th … snap position rather than switching lattices.
The asymmetry that remains is the safe one: some snap positions stop being
drawn, but nothing drawn is ever un-snappable. The readout says which
(`1 · every 5 drawn`) so the thinning is visible rather than mysterious.

Zooming in stops at `m = 1`. Subdividing further would draw lines you cannot
snap to, which is the same lie in the other direction.

Two smaller things fall out of it. Lines are indexed by whole multiples of the
step rather than accumulated as floats, so major-line selection is exact integer
arithmetic and index 0 is the origin — major lines cannot drift off the axes at
awkward zooms. And a `gridStep` of 0 (snapping off) draws no lattice at all,
because there is nothing honest to draw; the axes stay, since they are
coordinates rather than a claim about snapping.

## 10. Two stacked SVGs, one camera

`view/canvas.ts` renders artwork and overlay into two separate `<svg>` elements
sharing a viewBox and `preserveAspectRatio`. Grid, anchors, handles and marquee
live in the overlay; nothing decorative can end up in an export, and the
artwork layer is exactly what gets written out.

Zoom and pan move the **viewBox**, never a content transform. Screen-to-document
conversion is `getScreenCTM().inverse()`, so it stays correct under any page
layout without the code knowing anything about it.

Rendering is retained-mode with element pooling (`view/dom.ts`): elements are
reused frame to frame rather than rebuilt. Overlay redraws are
`requestAnimationFrame`-batched.

## 11. The window is the canvas

The shell is a fixed `100dvh` grid — command bar, work area, source drawer,
readout strip — and `body` is `overflow: hidden`. The page never scrolls,
because a scrolling page moves the canvas out from under coordinates that other
things already computed. That was not theoretical: the browser harness once
reported that clicking a node did nothing, when what had happened was that
typing into the source box scrolled itself into view and pushed the canvas off
the top.

Panels take space from the canvas rather than floating over it. Floating is
cheaper to build and looks tidier, but it means a document coordinate can be on
screen and unclickable at the same time, which is the same class of lie. So the
inspector is a real grid column and the source is a real grid row; when they
close, the canvas gets the pixels back. The one exception is below 860 px, where
the inspector floats after all — a 288 px column out of a 700 px window is worse
than the occlusion it avoids.

Which panels are open is view state, held as classes on `#app` and nothing
else. It is deliberately not in the store: it is not part of the document, it
should not be undoable, and putting it there would mean every drawer toggle
pushed a history entry.

The consequence is that the canvas box changes without the window changing, and
a camera left at the old aspect draws the document stretched. `window.resize`
does not fire for that, so the controller also watches the overlay with a
`ResizeObserver`, guarded by a `typeof` check because jsdom — where the DOM
tests run — does not implement one.

The `chrome` browser scenario asserts both halves: the canvas widens when the
inspector closes and tallens when the drawer does, the keyboard shortcuts land
in the same state as the buttons, and `scrollHeight` never exceeds
`clientHeight`.

## 12. Primitives are nodes from the start

There is no rect or ellipse in the model. `core/primitives.ts` builds them out
of the same nodes and handles as everything else, which is why a circle you have
just drawn can have one of its nodes dragged immediately — there is nothing to
convert, because there was never anything else.

A circle is four cubics with handles `KAPPA = 4/3·(√2−1)` times the radius,
round to about 2.7e-4 of it. Every node comes out symmetric by construction,
so it behaves like the smooth point it looks like without anything being
declared. A rounded rectangle is four quarter arcs and four straight sides, and
each corner takes two nodes: a node with a handle on one side and none on the
other, which `continuityOf` reads as a corner. That is correct — there is no
pair to keep in line — and it is what keeps the sides straight under later
edits.

`circulariseSubpath` is the inverse operation, and the interesting one.
`fitCircle` finds the best circle through the nodes by algebraic least squares
(Kåsa: `x² + y² = 2ax + 2by + c` is linear in the unknowns, so it is a solve
rather than an iteration, and centring the data first decouples `c` and keeps
the conditioning sane far from the origin). Each node then keeps its angle and
moves to the fitted radius.

The handles are rebuilt at `r · 4/3 · tan(θ/4)` for the angle θ each segment now
spans, which is the exact handle length for a circular arc and reduces to KAPPA
at a quarter turn. That is what makes the result independent of how the nodes
happened to be distributed: three bunched into a corner and two spread over the
rest come out as round as four even ones. Fitting is a compromise by nature — it
cannot know which node was the mistake — so the operation reports the radius it
found and how far the furthest node had to travel, and lets the reader judge.

## 13. Delete never refuses; break is the other operation

`deleteNode` used to keep a floor — three nodes for a closed subpath, two for
an open one — on the reasoning that a path being edited should not degenerate
into something that is not a path. It was the wrong trade, and it took a bug
report to see why.

Run in a loop over a selection, that floor turned "delete these eight" into
"delete five", silently. The three survivors read as a bug in the marquee, not
in delete. A closed path of three nodes could not be reduced at all, because it
was already sitting on the floor. The failure mode of refusing is invisible and
inexplicable; the failure mode it was guarding against — a two-node closed
subpath — is visible, obviously wrong on screen, and one undo away.

So there is no floor. A closed subpath goes down to two nodes quite happily:
two segments between the same pair of points, which draws as a line when they
are straight and a lens when they are curved. Below two nodes there are no
segments at all, so `deleteSelection` prunes what is left — but only from the
subpaths it touched, because a one-node subpath elsewhere is the pen mid-stroke
and deleting in one shape must not sweep up another.

What happens to the path *around* a deleted node is a setting, `state.deleteMode`,
because the two readings suit different work and neither is wrong.

**Fuse** joins the neighbours, so a pentagon becomes a quadrilateral. It is what
Illustrator, Inkscape and Figma all do on Delete, and what simplifying wants. It
is also approximate: `deleteNode` rescales the surviving handles to cover the
new span, which preserves the end tangents and nothing else.

**Split** leaves the path open at the gap. `deleteNodesSplitting` collects the
survivors into maximal runs of originally-adjacent nodes and makes each run a
subpath, so every segment that survives is *untouched* — bit-for-bit the one
that was there. Runs of one node are dropped, because a lone node has no
segments and the parser discards a bare `M` on the way back in.

It is the default that was the mistake to argue about, not the choice: fuse is
the safer default because it is the one every other editor trained people to
expect, and split is one click away in the Delete panel.

`breakAt`, on `Shift+B`, is a third thing and the one worth not confusing with
split-delete: it **keeps** the node and duplicates it.

|  | Delete · fuse | Delete · split | Break |
|---|---|---|---|
| Node count | −1 | −1 | **+1** |
| Path | stays whole | two ends | two ends |
| Geometry | approximated | **exact** | **exact** |
| Undoes | the point | the point and the join | the join |

Deleting-and-fusing is lossy by nature and the deviation is measured (see Known
limitations). The other two are exact by construction, and a test asserts the
contrast directly: on an S-curve, break drifts under 1e-9 where fuse drifts over
1. Offering only the lossy one was the real gap.

The mode is a preference rather than a modifier key, and it lives in its own
rail group rather than in Node. `.group.disabled` sets `pointer-events: none`
whenever nothing is selected, so a setting parked in the Node group would be
unreachable at exactly the moment you want to change it — before selecting the
thing you are about to delete.

## 14. Undo is whole-document snapshots

Not inverse operations. At icon and logo scale a snapshot is a few kilobytes,
and cloning it is cheaper than maintaining an inverse for every operation and
being wrong about one of them — a wrong inverse corrupts the document silently.

`beginBatch`/`endBatch` make a drag one undo entry rather than one per frame.

If a snapshot ever becomes too slow, that is a measurable problem with a known
fix. A wrong inverse is neither.

## 15. Booleans are the one thing not written here

`io/boolean.ts` is an adapter over [PathBool.js](https://github.com/r-flash/PathBool.js).

A correct boolean needs every curve-curve intersection found, a planar graph
built from them, winding numbers resolved per face, and all of it surviving
tangency and self-intersection. Getting it subtly wrong produces output that
looks right until it does not.

Its segment format happens to be our node model — a cubic is
`["C", p0, c1, c2, p3]` — so the adapter is a translation, not an integration
layer. It never touches path-data strings; we keep our own parser and serialiser
on both sides.

Vendoring the source was measured and rejected: 4 925 lines, more than this
entire editor, and only 92 of them concern arcs, so trimming to the subset we
feed it would save nothing while forfeiting upstream fixes.

Wiring it up cost **+35.8 kB raw, +12.8 kB gzipped** — the whole reason the
adapter sat unreferenced until the operations were actually wanted.

Two things guard the boundary, because the author calls the library early-stage
and asks for failure cases:

- `booleanShapes` **throws** on non-finite output rather than returning it. A
  NaN that reaches the document cannot be undone out of it — by then it is
  already in a history snapshot — so the check has to happen before the commit,
  and its failure has to be distinguishable from a legitimately empty result.
- `Controller.booleanSelection` catches, reports, and leaves the document
  untouched. Nothing is mutated until a finite result exists.

Selection order is document order, which is paint order: the first shape
survives with its id, name and style, and the rest are consumed. That makes
`subtract` bottom-minus-the-rest, matching Inkscape's Difference and
Illustrator's Minus Front, and it means the result inherits the appearance of
the shape it visually replaced. It requires a whole-shape selection — inferring
which shape was meant from a couple of selected nodes would be a guess made
silently and destructively.

---

## Known limitations

Recorded because a document listing only the wins is not worth reading.

**Deleting a node across an inflection is genuinely lossy.** Fusing two
segments into one rescales the surviving handles, which preserves the end
tangents and nothing else. On an S-curve, where the deleted node *is* the
direction change, no single cubic can replace two. Measured maximum deviation
is **7.55 on an 80-unit span**. Two tests assert this is both non-zero and
bounded, rather than one test asserting a flattering number.

**Not every snap position is drawn when zoomed out.** The converse — a drawn
line you cannot snap to — is impossible by construction, and that is the half
that matters. See §9.

**Arc round-trip is one-way.** See §2.

**PathBool.js is early-stage** by its author's own description, who asks for
failure cases. Treat returned geometry as untrusted: check it is non-empty and
finite, and keep operands on the undo stack.

**One reported rendering bug was never reproduced.** A screenshot showed stray
path fragments. Overlay pools were proven to clear correctly, and rendering
invariants hold through pen sessions, undo/redo, deletion, transforms and
Apply. Two plausible causes were found and fixed — one-node ghost shapes, and
a source-Apply collapse — but neither was confirmed to be *the* one. If it
recurs, the `d` string or click sequence would settle it.

---

## Testing philosophy

Where a test could pass for the wrong reason, measure rather than compare.

Three bad tests were caught and rewritten during development, and the pattern
in all three was the same — an assertion that looked strict but wasn't:

- Comparing point **sets** reported 0.72 error on a curve split that was
  numerically exact. Replaced with projected deviation.
- A transform test needed index-wise comparison, because an affine map
  preserves parameterisation and a set comparison would hide a reordering.
- A flip-involution test used a shape symmetric about the flip axis. It would
  have passed with flipping entirely broken.

The same reasoning drives the boolean tests: they assert enclosed **area**, not
path strings. A boolean is obliged to produce a region, not a particular
spelling of one. A fourth bad test was caught while wiring them up — it checked
that a subtraction's `d` contained the substring `0 0`, which the serialiser
never emits because it writes `H 0` instead. The direction of the subtraction is
now checked by bounding box, which distinguishes the two ways round; the area
does not, since both leave 300.

`test/grid.test.ts` states the §9 contract as an invariant and sweeps it across
six orders of magnitude of zoom and nine snap steps, rather than checking a few
representative cases. The contract is exact — a line is either on the lattice or
it isn't — so there is no tolerance to tune and no reason not to sweep. The same
check runs against a real layout engine in the `gridHonesty` browser scenario,
because the step depends on a measured element width that jsdom does not have.
