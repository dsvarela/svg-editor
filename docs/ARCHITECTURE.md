# Architecture

Why the code looks the way it does. Each section is a decision, what it bought,
and what it cost.

---

## 1. Nodes, not commands

**The founding decision, and every other one follows from it.**

yqnn's editor stores an array of command objects — `MoveTo`, `CurveTo`,
`EllipticalArcTo` — and derives point positions by walking the whole path from
the start. That is why its interface is a command table: the model *is* a
command table. It also means every geometric operation has to special-case ten
command types. Its `EllipticalArcTo.scale` is 28 lines of conic-section algebra
whose entire purpose is keeping an ellipse expressible as an `A` command.

Here a subpath is a run of nodes. Each node owns its anchor and up to two
handles. Commands exist only in `parse.ts` on the way in and `serialise.ts` on
the way out. Nothing between them knows they exist.

What that buys:

- A transform is one matrix applied to every point. No special cases at all —
  compare `affine.ts` (79 lines, covering everything) to that arc-scaling method.
- No relative-versus-absolute distinction to carry around.
- Arcs and shorthands cannot desynchronise from what is drawn, because they no
  longer exist once parsed.

What it costs: the serialiser has to *re-derive* a good spelling rather than
remembering one. See §8.

## 2. All segments are cubics

`M L H V C S Q T A` are read on input and written on output; in between there
are only cubic Béziers. Arcs are converted by the SVG 1.1 endpoint-to-centre
formulas (F.6.5, with the radii correction from F.6.6) and then flattened to
cubics; quadratics are degree-elevated.

The conversion is one-way. A shape imported as an arc will not come back out as
an arc. That is a real loss, accepted deliberately: keeping arcs as arcs is
exactly the special-casing §1 exists to avoid, and every operation — split,
transform, boolean, offset — would have to grow an arc branch.

## 3. A straight segment has no handles

A handle is `null` when the segment it governs is straight, rather than a
control point sitting on top of its anchor.

This makes "is this segment a line?" an exact boolean rather than a float
comparison, which is what lets the serialiser emit `L`/`H`/`V` losslessly
instead of guessing from near-zero distances. `segmentIsLine` is two `=== null`
checks.

The cost is that geometry code cannot assume a handle exists. `segmentAsCubic`
widens a line into a cubic with its controls on the endpoints, so downstream
code sees a uniform shape while the model still remembers the truth.

## 4. Handles are absolute, not offsets

`hIn` and `hOut` are document coordinates, not deltas from the anchor.

Absolute costs one addition when moving an anchor. Offsets would cost a
conversion on every hit-test, render and transform — all of which happen far
more often than anchor moves.

## 5. Transforms are baked, never stored

Rotating a shape rewrites its points. There is no transform matrix hanging off
a shape waiting to be composed at render time.

This means what you see in the source box is what is actually stored: no hidden
coordinate system, no `transform=` attribute that the numbers have to be read
through. Imported `transform` attributes are baked on the way in for the same
reason.

The cost is accumulated floating-point drift under repeated transforms, and
that a rotation is not undoable by rotating back — it is undoable through the
undo stack, which is where it belongs.

## 6. A point is a point

There is no stored node type. Continuity — corner, smooth, symmetric — is
**derived from the handles** wherever it is needed (`continuityOf` in
`core/types.ts`).

A stored flag can disagree with the geometry, and did in every editor that has
one: a file can claim `smooth` while its handles sit at ninety degrees. Worse
for us, an imported path has no such flag to import, so everything read as
`corner` and dragging a handle on a visibly smooth imported curve put a kink in
it.

Deriving it means:

- Nothing to choose before drawing. Draw points; the handles decide.
- The marker on screen cannot lie, because it is computed from the same
  geometry every frame.
- "Make this smooth" is a real edit to the handles, not a mode change. The old
  version set a flag, changed nothing visible, and silently altered the next
  drag.

`moveHandle` reads the relationship **before** it mutates. This is the whole
trick: afterwards the pair is no longer collinear and would always read as a
corner, so a smooth node would break itself on its first drag. Having read it,
mirroring produces exactly equal lengths, so the relation is self-maintaining
for the life of a drag. `Alt` breaks the pair, and "broken" needs no flag to
persist — it is just non-collinear geometry.

Two tolerances, in `core/types.ts`:

- **Collinearity: 1e-4 radians.** Not an epsilon on the raw numbers. A rotation
  is exact in theory and nearly exact in floating point, so a tight test would
  turn a mirrored pair into a corner after a rotate-and-bake. 1e-4 rad is
  ~0.006°, far below what anyone can place by eye and far above that drift.
- **Equal length: 1e-6 relative.** A non-uniform scale legitimately destroys
  equal lengths, and correctly demotes symmetric to smooth.

## 7. Bend is a view, not a replacement

`core/bend.ts` describes a curved segment with two numbers — how far it bows
away from the chord, and how taut it is — after TikZiT's edge model, which
[quiver](https://q.uiver.app/) and TikZ itself independently arrive at.

It is a **view over the handles**, not a second representation. The model still
stores two control points; `bendToHandles` and `bendOf` convert. One source of
truth means a bend and a hand-dragged handle can never disagree, and dropping
back into free-handle editing costs nothing.

`bendOf` returns `null` for an asymmetric segment, which is how the UI knows to
stop offering the bend control. A straight segment reads as angle 0, so it can
be bent directly without being "converted" to a curve first.

## 8. The serialiser re-derives the shortest spelling

Since the model has no commands, output is reconstructed: absolute versus
relative per command, whichever is shorter; `H`/`V` where an axis is unchanged;
`L` where the handles are null; `S` where a control is the reflection of the
previous one; and `Q` where a cubic is exactly a degree-elevated quadratic.

The parser reads everything (`M L H V C S Q T A Z`, relative or absolute); the
serialiser deliberately emits a narrower set. `T` is never written — its
reflection rule chains across commands, so a single edited node changes the
meaning of every `T` after it, which is a poor trade for a few bytes.

Two things learned the hard way here, both preserved as comments in the code:

**Track the pen through the emitter, not alongside it.** Relative output
accumulates: each command's numbers are relative to where the previous one left
the pen, so the serialiser must know that position *as the text encodes it*.
Rounding with `Math.round(v*f)/f` while emitting with `toFixed` produces
different answers for binary values just under a halfway point, and the error
banks one grid step at a time. It took a 2 000-segment test to surface.

**Handles never affect the pen.** Only anchors need rounding-aware comparison.
An earlier "fix" that quantised whole subpaths broke `Q` recovery, because
`cubicAsQuad` amplifies control-point rounding by 1.5×.

## 9. Two stacked SVGs, one camera

`view/canvas.ts` renders artwork and overlay into two separate `<svg>` elements
sharing a viewBox and `preserveAspectRatio`. Grid, anchors, handles and marquee
live in the overlay; nothing decorative can end up in an export, and the
artwork layer is exactly what gets written out.

Zoom and pan move the **viewBox**, never a content transform. Screen-to-document
conversion is `getScreenCTM().inverse()`, so it stays correct under any page
layout without the code knowing anything about it.

Rendering is retained-mode with element pooling (`view/dom.ts`): elements are
reused frame to frame rather than rebuilt. Overlay redraws are
`requestAnimationFrame`-batched.

## 10. Undo is whole-document snapshots

Not inverse operations. At icon and logo scale a snapshot is a few kilobytes,
and cloning it is cheaper than maintaining an inverse for every operation and
being wrong about one of them — a wrong inverse corrupts the document silently.

`beginBatch`/`endBatch` make a drag one undo entry rather than one per frame.

If a snapshot ever becomes too slow, that is a measurable problem with a known
fix. A wrong inverse is neither.

## 11. Booleans are the one thing not written here

`io/boolean.ts` is an adapter over [PathBool.js](https://github.com/r-flash/PathBool.js).

A correct boolean needs every curve-curve intersection found, a planar graph
built from them, winding numbers resolved per face, and all of it surviving
tangency and self-intersection. Getting it subtly wrong produces output that
looks right until it does not.

Its segment format happens to be our node model — a cubic is
`["C", p0, c1, c2, p3]` — so the adapter is a translation, not an integration
layer. It never touches path-data strings; we keep our own parser and serialiser
on both sides.

Vendoring the source was measured and rejected: 4 925 lines, more than this
entire editor, and only 92 of them concern arcs, so trimming to the subset we
feed it would save nothing while forfeiting upstream fixes.

---

## Known limitations

Recorded because a document listing only the wins is not worth reading.

**Deleting a node across an inflection is genuinely lossy.** Fusing two
segments into one rescales the surviving handles, which preserves the end
tangents and nothing else. On an S-curve, where the deleted node *is* the
direction change, no single cubic can replace two. Measured maximum deviation
is **7.55 on an 80-unit span**. Two tests assert this is both non-zero and
bounded, rather than one test asserting a flattering number.

**The grid you see is not the grid you snap to.** `canvas.ts` draws an adaptive
decade step derived from zoom; `controller.ts` snaps to the fixed `gridStep`.
At most zoom levels you snap to a lattice that is not the one on screen. This
undermines the premise of a grid editor and is first on the shopping list.

**Arc round-trip is one-way.** See §2.

**PathBool.js is early-stage** by its author's own description, who asks for
failure cases. Treat returned geometry as untrusted: check it is non-empty and
finite, and keep operands on the undo stack.

**One reported rendering bug was never reproduced.** A screenshot showed stray
path fragments. Overlay pools were proven to clear correctly, and rendering
invariants hold through pen sessions, undo/redo, deletion, transforms and
Apply. Two plausible causes were found and fixed — one-node ghost shapes, and
a source-Apply collapse — but neither was confirmed to be *the* one. If it
recurs, the `d` string or click sequence would settle it.

## Testing philosophy

Where a test could pass for the wrong reason, measure rather than compare.

Three bad tests were caught and rewritten during development, and the pattern
in all three was the same — an assertion that looked strict but wasn't:

- Comparing point **sets** reported 0.72 error on a curve split that was
  numerically exact. Replaced with projected deviation.
- A transform test needed index-wise comparison, because an affine map
  preserves parameterisation and a set comparison would hide a reordering.
- A flip-involution test used a shape symmetric about the flip axis. It would
  have passed with flipping entirely broken.

The same reasoning drives the boolean tests: they assert enclosed **area**, not
path strings. A boolean is obliged to produce a region, not a particular
spelling of one.
